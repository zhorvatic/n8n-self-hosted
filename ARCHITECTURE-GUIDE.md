## The Big Picture: What Are We Building?

We're building a **workflow automation platform** that can:
- Run automated tasks and integrations 24/7
- Connect to external APIs and services
- Use AI (our personal Ollama instance) for intelligent workflows
- Scale reliably without manual intervention
- Stay secure and accessible from anywhere

Think of it like Zapier, but self-hosted and integrated with our own AI model.

## Why This Architecture? The Core Problems We're Solving

### Problem 1: "I want to run workflows 24/7 without my laptop being on"
**Solution**: Cloud hosting on AWS EC2
- EC2 gives us a computer that runs 24/7 in the cloud
- We pay only for what we use
- AWS handles the physical infrastructure

### Problem 2: "I want my workflows to use AI, but ChatGPT API is expensive"
**Solution**: Personal Ollama instance + Cloudflare tunnel
- Run our own AI model on a powerful gaming PC (RTX 5080)
- Cloudflare tunnel securely connects our home PC to the cloud
- No API costs, full control over the model

### Problem 3: "I need this to be reliable and not break"
**Solution**: Multiple layers of redundancy and health checks
- Load balancer distributes traffic
- Health checks automatically restart failed services
- Database backups prevent data loss
- Monitoring tells us when something's wrong

## Component Breakdown: What Each Piece Does

### 1. Personal PC with Ollama
**What it is**: Your gaming computer running an AI model
**Why we need it**: 
- Free AI inference (no API costs)
- Full control over model and data
- Powerful GPU (RTX 5080) for fast responses

**Real-world analogy**: Like having your own personal AI assistant that never leaves your house, but can still help with work tasks remotely.

### 2. Cloudflare Tunnel
**What it is**: A secure connection between your home PC and the internet
**Why we need it**:
- Your home PC doesn't have a public IP address
- ISPs block incoming connections for security
- Cloudflare creates a secure "tunnel" through their network

**Real-world analogy**: Like a private phone line between your house and your office that goes through a trusted operator.

### 3. AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
**What it is**: The "front door" that receives all web traffic
**Why we need it**:
- Handles SSL certificates (the lock icon in browsers)
- Can distribute traffic to multiple servers (even though we only have one)
- AWS manages it, so it's highly reliable

**Real-world analogy**: Like a receptionist at a company who greets visitors and directs them to the right department.

### 4. EC2 Instance (The Main Server)
**What it is**: A virtual computer running in AWS
**Why we chose t3.small**:
- Cost-effective for our workload
- Can handle N8N + database + web server
- Easy to upgrade if we need more power

**Real-world analogy**: Like renting a small office space - you get what you need without buying a whole building.

### 5. Nginx (Reverse Proxy)
**What it is**: A web server that sits in front of N8N
**Why we need it**:
- N8N isn't designed to handle internet traffic directly
- Nginx is battle-tested for web traffic
- Provides health checks and version endpoints
- Can serve static files efficiently

**Real-world analogy**: Like a security guard who checks visitors before they enter the building and directs them to the right floor.

### 6. N8N Application
**What it is**: The actual workflow automation software
**Why Docker**:
- Consistent environment (works the same everywhere)
- Easy updates and rollbacks
- Isolated from the host system

**Real-world analogy**: Like having your application in a shipping container - it works the same whether it's on a truck, ship, or train.

### 7. PostgreSQL Database
**What it is**: Where N8N stores all workflow data
**Why PostgreSQL**:
- Reliable and well-supported by N8N
- ACID compliance (data integrity)
- Good performance for our use case

**Real-world analogy**: Like a filing cabinet that never loses documents and can quickly find what you're looking for.

## Security Layers: Defense in Depth

### Layer 1: Cloudflare Access
- Only authorized users can reach the N8N interface
- Protects against random internet attacks
- Free tier includes basic DDoS protection

### Layer 2: AWS Security Groups
- Firewall rules at the network level
- Only allows specific ports and protocols
- Blocks everything else by default

### Layer 3: Application-Level Security
- N8N has its own user authentication
- Database credentials stored securely in AWS Parameter Store
- No secrets in code or configuration files

## Data Flow: Following a Request

1. **User visits n8n.zvonkos.com**
2. **Cloudflare** checks if user is authorized
3. **AWS ALB** receives the request and terminates SSL
4. **Nginx** on EC2 receives HTTP request from ALB
5. **Nginx** proxies request to N8N container
6. **N8N** processes request, may query PostgreSQL
7. **Response flows back**: N8N → Nginx → ALB → Cloudflare → User

## Deployment Strategy: How Code Gets to Production

### The Problem
- We want to deploy new versions safely
- We need zero-downtime deployments
- We want to be able to rollback quickly

### The Solution: Artifact-Based Deployment
1. **GitHub Actions** builds a deployment package
2. **Package uploaded** to S3 for storage
3. **AWS SSM** runs deployment commands on EC2
4. **Health checks** verify the deployment worked
5. **Rollback available** by deploying previous artifact

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Check Strategy
- **Nginx health**: Is the web server responding?
- **N8N health**: Is the application working?
- **Database health**: Can we connect to PostgreSQL?
- **Version endpoint**: What version is currently deployed?

### Logging Strategy
- **Application logs**: Docker container logs
- **Deployment logs**: CloudWatch for deployment history
- **System logs**: Standard Linux logs on EC2

## Cost Optimization Decisions

### Why Not Kubernetes?
- **Complexity**: Overkill for a single application
- **Cost**: EKS costs $72/month just for the control plane
- **Maintenance**: Docker Compose is much simpler

### Why Not RDS?
- **Cost**: RDS has additional overhead costs
- **Simplicity**: PostgreSQL in Docker is easier to backup with EBS
- **Control**: Full control over database configuration

### Why Not Serverless?
- **State**: N8N needs persistent connections and state
- **Cost**: Would be more expensive for 24/7 workloads
- **Complexity**: Cold starts would hurt user experience

## Other Talking Points

### Technical Decisions
- "I chose this architecture to balance cost, reliability, and simplicity"
- "Each component has a specific purpose and can be upgraded independently"
- "Security is implemented in layers, not just one place"

### Problem-Solving Examples
- "When I needed AI integration, I evaluated cloud APIs vs self-hosting and chose self-hosting for cost and control"
- "I implemented health checks at multiple levels to catch different types of failures"
- "I used infrastructure as code principles with Docker Compose and GitHub Actions"

### Scalability Considerations
- "The current setup handles our needs, but I designed it to scale horizontally"
- "Database and application are separated, so they can scale independently"
- "The artifact-based deployment makes it easy to deploy to multiple environments"

## What This Demonstrates

### DevOps Skills
- Infrastructure as Code (Docker Compose, GitHub Actions)
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Monitoring and logging strategy
- Security best practices

### Cloud Architecture
- Multi-service application design
- Load balancing and reverse proxy patterns
- Secret management with AWS Parameter Store
- Backup and disaster recovery planning

### Problem-Solving Approach
- Evaluated multiple solutions (cloud AI vs self-hosted)
- Made cost-conscious decisions
- Implemented monitoring from day one
- Designed for maintainability

## Future Improvements

### Short Term
- Add monitoring and alerting (CloudWatch alarms)
- Implement log aggregation (ELK stack or CloudWatch Insights)
- Add automated testing for workflows

### Long Term
- Multi-region deployment for disaster recovery
- Auto-scaling based on usage patterns
- Migration to container orchestration if complexity grows
